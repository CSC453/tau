= CSC 453 Milestone 9 (Offsets)
<csc-453-milestone-9-offsets>
== Goal:
<goal>
This milestone is to decorate/annotate an Tauâ€™s variable and parameter
symbols with their offsets. This phase directly follows typechecking.

== Specifications
<specifications>
The Tau language specification is a separate document.

The AST nodes are defined in `asts.py`.

Symbols and types are defined in `symbols.py`.

== Create `offsets.py`
<create-offsets.py>
You will start with the supplied stub file called `offsets.py` that will
contain the code for annotating the AST and Symbols with computed
offsets.

To accomplish this, you will walk the AST built by your parser (after
doing typechecking).

Specifically you will need to: \* Update the `offset` field of Symbols
that represent local variables and parameters. Assume that all `int` and
`bool` values have unit (`1`) size. \* Update the `size` field of the
`FuncDecl` AST node to be the total size of the local variablels
#strong[AND] the 3 extra slots for the return address, old frame
pointer, and old stack pointer. (Note that the parameters are
#strong[not] included in the size of the local variables.) \* The local
variables must be #emph[packed] (no gaps) as described in class. \* Your
compiler does not need to handle arrays.

#strong[NOTE:] The parameter offsets will all be negative values
relative to the `SP`/`FP`, but they will start at `-2`. (The return
value will be at offset `-1`)

Example:

```
func f(
    int x,    // -2
    int y,    // -3
    int z)    // -4
{  
    int a;    // 3
    {
        int b;    // 4
    }
    while true {
        int c;    // 4  <-- packed!!
        int d;    // 5
    }
}     // size = 6
```

== Errors
<errors>
This milestone only requires that you correctly annotate a correct Tau
program.

== Difficulty
<difficulty>
This milestone does not require a lot of code beyond the tree walker,
which is provided. That said, it can be a little tricky to check and
infer types for some nodes.

Start early and ask questions.

== Standard Requirements
<standard-requirements>
Your program must meet all the requirements outlined in the common
requirements document.
