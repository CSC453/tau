= CSC 453 Milestone 10 (Register Assignment)
<csc-453-milestone-10-register-assignment>
== Goal:
<goal>
This milestone is to decorate/annotate an Tauâ€™s `Expr` AST with register
assignments. This phase directly follows offset assignment.

== Specifications
<specifications>
The Tau language specification is a separate document.

The AST nodes are defined in `asts.py`.

Symbols and types are defined in `symbols.py`.

== Create `assign.py`
<create-assign.py>
You will start with the supplied stub file called `assign.py` that will
contain the code for annotating the `Expr` AST and Symbols with computed
register assignments.

EVERY `Expr` AST node must have a `reg` field that is a string (e.g.,
`"r1"`, `"r2"`). The registers are assigned in the following way:

+ The registers are numbered from `r1` to `rN`. There are an infinite
  number of registers available.
+ The registers are assigned Left-to-Right, using as few registers as
  possible.

== Errors
<errors>
This milestone only requires that you correctly annotate a correct Tau
program.

== Difficulty
<difficulty>
This milestone does not require a lot of code beyond the tree walker,
which is provided. That said, it can be a little tricky to check and
infer types for some nodes.

Start early and ask questions.

== Standard Requirements
<standard-requirements>
Your program must meet all the requirements outlined in the common
requirements document.
