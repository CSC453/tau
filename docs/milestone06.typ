= CSC 453 Milestone 6 (Build AST)
<csc-453-milestone-6-build-ast>

== Goal:
<goal>
This milestone is to build an AST for a syntactically correct Tau
program.

== Specifications
<specifications>
The Tau language specification is a separate document.

The AST nodes are defined in `asts.py`.

== Editting your `parse.py`
<editting-your-parse.py>
You created a recursive descent parser in the previous milestone. You
will now modify your parser to build an AST.

When completed, the `Parser.parse()` method will return an AST. It will
return the root of the AST, which will have the type `asts.Program`.

== `tau/asts.py`
<tauasts.py>
You will be given `asts.py`. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE. You will use the
classes defined in this file to build your AST.

== Notes
<notes>
The Tau language specification is intentionally vague. Feel free to
publically discuss the language specification on Piazza. If you have
questions, please ask.

Also, `asts.py` has scant comments. Look at the initializers to
understand them.

== Difficulty
<difficulty>
Your grammar may not be the same as my grammar. Thatâ€™s OK. The goal is
to get a working parser.

That said, grammar writing can be tricky. Start early and ask questions.

== Standard Requirements
<standard-requirements>
Your program must meet all the requirements outlined in the common
requirements document.
